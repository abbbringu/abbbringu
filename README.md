Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Brian, and Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student at Chalmers University of Technology.

Throughout my studies, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in programming, system development, machine learning, databases, and statistics.

Alongside my studies, Iâ€™ve worked with applied machine learning and big data, and Iâ€™ve developed production systems powered by large language models (LLMs). I also work part-time as a Head Developer, which provides me with valuable hands-on experience in leading development projects and bridging theory with practice.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science and AI, further deepening my expertise in this exciting field.
