Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Brian and I am a computer engineering student at Chalmers University of Technology.

During my studies, I have delved into various programming concepts such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, data structures, parallel programming, and control engineering.

I am also active with personal projects in web development, app development, and web scraping.

I have practical experience programming in several languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, C++, Java, React, and Kotlin.

I am pursuing an MSc in Data Science and AI, further deepening my knowledge and skills in this exciting field.
